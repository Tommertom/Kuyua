This is an abandoned project. It has the features for a market place app with the folling included:

- Google Maps
- Google Analytics/Facebook analytics, including a decorator to flag various actions of the user
- Signup flow using email - with firebase functions
- Angular Service worker integration with Firebase messaging - this was a hard one 
- Various sharing features 
- Realtime posting and seeing new ads
- emails and notifications from the server if something new was posted
- static landing page to cater for Facebook ad testing - not to loose people during the conversion

So actually, quite cool from a feature perspective. It just did not materialise as app
